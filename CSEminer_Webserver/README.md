CSE-miner attempts to prioritize highly expressed protein-coding exons as targets for antibody/CAR-based therapy.

ExonID: Exon coordinates on the hg38 genome
GeneName: Gene Symbol
CandidateCategory: 
   1. Tier1 candidates: high-priority candidates with limited expression in normal samples.
   2. Tier2 candidates: candidates with expression in key normal tissues.
Class: 
   1. Gene target: gene-level candidates
   2. AS target: alternatively spliced exon target
