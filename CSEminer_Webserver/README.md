CSE-miner attempts to prioritize highly expressed protein-coding exons as targets for antibody/CAR-based therapy.

ExonID: Exon coordinates on the hg38 genome
GeneName: Gene Symbol
CandidateCategory: 
   1. Tier1 candidates: high-priority candidates with limited expression in normal samples.
   2. Tier2 candidates: candidates with expression in key normal tissues.
Class: 
   1. Gene target: gene-level candidates
   2. AS target: alternatively spliced exon target
GTEx_Normal:
   List of normal tissue with high expression of the exon target.
TargetDisease:
   List of diseases that the exon can be used to target.
ProteinType
   Annotation of the protein category. ECM - extracellular matrix. 
Location
   Major protein localization categories. Matrisome, Surfaceome, and Surfaceome+Matrisome.
