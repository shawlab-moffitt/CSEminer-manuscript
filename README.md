# Companion CSEminer Custom Pipeline for the Analysis of Pediatric Solid Tumors
# Introduction

The use of T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) in immunotherapy offers a potential avenue for enhancing outcomes in pediatric solid tumors, including brain tumors. However, the effectiveness of CAR T cells in combating solid and brain tumors has been limited. The lack of efficacy is likely due to multiple factors, such as suboptimal T-cell fitness, inadequate tumor site homing, the challenging tumor microenvironment, and a limited range of targetable antigens. Current strategies for identifying new targets on the surface of pediatric solid tumors have mainly relied on differential gene expression analysis, typically within a specific subtype of cancer. These approaches may overlook opportunities to discover pan-cancer targets that are effective across various subtypes, as well as cancer-specific exons (CSEs) resulting from alternative splicing. To address this, we conducted an analysis using 1,532 RNA-seq samples from the St. Jude/Washington University Pediatric Cancer Genome Project (PCGP), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatment (TARGET), and St. Jude Childrenâ€™s Research Hospital (St. Jude) Cloud real-time clinical genomics data (ClinGen).

# 2.3. Merge Exon Scores from Solid and Brain Tumors.
The following command will run a custom script to merge all the exon scores together into a single file.
```

```
# 2.4. Annotate putatively spliced exons
The custom Java program checks whether the exon marked as differentially expressed and enriched in the tumor is an exon that is part of an alternative transcript.
